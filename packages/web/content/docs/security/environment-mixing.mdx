## What is environment mixing?

Environment mixing happens when you accidentally load secrets from the wrong environment. For example, you might load production secrets in a development environment, or vice versa. This can lead to serious security/application issues, and it's important to prevent it.

## How Fatima helps

Fatima will require you to explicitly define a `environment` function in your `env.config.ts` file

```ts title="env.config.ts"
export default config({
  environment: ({ processEnv }) => processEnv.NODE_ENV,
});
```

When Fatima tries to load secrets, it uses the `environment` function to determine which environment to load variables from.

However, right after all secrets are loaded, Fatima injects them into `process.env` and runs the `environment` function again.

If for some reason the `environment` function returns a different environment than the one loaded, Fatima will throw an error.

By doing so we can add a double layer of security to make sure that the loaded secrets are from the same environment as the one we're asking them for, or vice-versa.

<Callout type="info" title="Don't worry about 'fatima generate'">
  Although `fatima generate` temporarily loads secrets names and values to generate types,
  it doesn't inject them anywhere in your application.

It's a safe command to run, and you don't need to worry about environment mixing when running it.

## How you could mess up

### 1. Using `WHATEVER_ENV=production fatima run` in development

Few people will define a `load.production` function in config, that's because `fatima run` generally should not be used in production.

Production variables should be loaded in CI/CD pipelines, directly into the hosting machine `process.env`.

But if you actually defined `load.production` and you run the command described above, you will load production secrets into your local process. Not much to do here, Fatima can't help you with that.

As for the existance of the `fatima run` command, I've also questioned it, but it is nice for testing purposes.

### 2. Setting the wrong environments in your secret storage

Unfortunately, there's not much to do if you set your production database URL in your secret storage development environment. Fatima can't help you with that.
