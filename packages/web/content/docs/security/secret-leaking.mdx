# ESlint

## The Plugin

The fatima eslint plugin provides two rules: `no-process-env` and `no-env`.

The former is enabled by default, and it will prevent you from accessing `process.env` in your codebase.

This helps you avoid accidentally leaking secrets, as `process.env` does not provide any kind of safety. It also keeps your codebase consistent.

The latter prevents you from acessing the `env` object generated by fatima, and it needs to be enabled manually as it requires you to specify the files you don't want to access the object.

## Setup

```ts title="eslint.config.ts"
import { linter as fatima } from "fatima";

export default [
  fatima.eslint.plugin,
  fatima.eslint.noEnvRule("**/*.tsx"),
] satisfies ESLintConfig;
```

This will prevent you from accessing secrets in any `.tsx` file, but you can specify any other file type you want.
