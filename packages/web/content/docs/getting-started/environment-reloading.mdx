title: Environment reloading
description: No more restarts, never.

Restarting a process is really annoying, especially when dealing with slow builds, fatima helps you with that by providing ways of runtime reloading your environment variables.

## Watching local changes

Reloading for local files is enabled by default when using `fatima dev`.

All `.env` except `.example.env` files will be watched for changes and reloaded automatically.

## Watching cloud changes

You can also setup a webhook with `fatima dev` to listen to your secret manager for changes.

```typescript title="fatima.config.ts"
export default config({
  hook: {
    port: 4242,
  },
});
```

This will spin up an endpoint at `http://localhost:4242/fatima` accepting any HTTP method to trigger a reload.

It is your job to provide the tunneling service, here's a list of services you can use:

- [zrok](https://zrok.io/)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)
- [localtunnel](https://localtunnel.github.io/www/)
- [localhost.run](https://localhost.run/)

For much more, check the [Awesome Tunneling repo](https://github.com/anderspitman/awesome-tunneling)

After setting up the tunneling you just need to set the webhook URL in your secret manager to the endpoint URL.

## My secret manager does not support webhooks

This usually happens with tools that _have_ a secret manager but aren't secret managers themselves: vercel, railway, trigger.dev, etc.

In this case, you can use the `fatima reload` command to trigger a reload.

```bash
fatima reload
```

You can run this command without stopping any process, it will work as the webhook would (maybe even faster depending on you).

  This won't work if you're not running the server, remember to add the ``port``
  option.
