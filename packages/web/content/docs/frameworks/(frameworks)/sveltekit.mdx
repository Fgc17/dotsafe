## What should I know?

Here's a list of things you should know before starting with SvelteKit:

- SvelteKit natively supports environments type safety (no need for Fatima's client).
- SvelteKit natively deals with private and public secrets (again no need for Fatima's client)
- SvelteKit natively deals with [environment mixing](/docs/security/environment-mixing) (no need for Fatima's ESLint rule).

## How to integrate with Fatima

Things are pretty straight forward, but as mentioned, you won't need Fatima's generated client neither the provided ESLint rule.

As we won't be generating the client, Fatima provides underlying type API so that you can generate your validation constraints.

## Dev script

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "fatima dev --lite -- vite dev"
  }
}
```

The `--lite` flag will disable the client generation.

## Config file

```ts
import { env } from "$env/dynamic/private";
import { EnvRecord } from "fatima/env";
import { validate, config, adapters } from "fatima";
import { z, ZodType } from "zod";
import dotenv from "dotenv";

type DynamicPrivateEnvObject = typeof env;

type Constraint = EnvRecord<DynamicPrivateEnvObject, ZodType>;

export const constraint: Constraint = {
  NODE_ENV: z.enum(["development", "staging", "production"]),
  PORT: z.number().int().positive(),
  API_URL: z.string().url(),
};

type Environment = 'development' | 'staging' | 'production'

export default config<Environment>({
  environment: (processEnv) => processEnv.NODE_ENV ?? "development"
  validate: validate.zod(constraint),
  load: {
    development: [adapters.dotenv.load(dotenv)]
  }
});
```
