## How they work

People get confused on how client secrets works, it is easy: they are variables that get defined through `.env` content instead of hard coding.

Your server variables will never be defined on the client, your SSR framework won't allow it.

<Callout type="warn" title="Be careful!">
  Your framework will not ship server secrets to the client, but no one said you
  can't mess up and pass them by yourself through routes or html server
  rendering.

Check out the [fatima eslint rule](/docs/security/secret-leaking) for partially helping you with that.

## How to set them up

You can start using client secrets by specifying a client prefix in your config file:

```ts title="env.config.ts"
import { config } from "fatima";

export default config({
  client: {
    publicPrefix: "NEXT_PUBLIC_",
  },
});
```

From now on, as soon as you hit `fatima generate`, all your `.env` variables prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` will be available under `publicEnv`.

## Calling `publicEnv`

So you generated your client secrets, here's how you would call them:

```tsx
import { publicEnv } from "env";

export default function Home() {
  return <div>{publicEnv.MY_SECRET}</div>;
}
```

<Callout type="info" title="We won't leak your secret names!">

Even though fatima uses a single file for accessing both server and client secrets, we do not leak your server secret names to the client, that's because the server secret names are only types, not values.
