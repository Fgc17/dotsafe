### Modifying the `isServer` function

The default way fatima checks if you are on the server is currently the following:

```ts title="fatima/src/env/env.ts"
() => typeof window === "undefined";
```

This works for 99% of the cases, but there are other ways to make the check.

There's actually a library called [browser-or-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/browser-or-node) that can help you with that.

If you want to use this library or already do so, you can modify the `isServer` function like this:

```ts title="env.config.ts"
import { config } from "fatima";
import * as jsEnv from "browser-or-node";

const isServer = !jsEnv.isBrowser;

export default config({
  client: {
    isServer: () => isServer,
    publicPrefix: "NEXT_PUBLIC_",
  },
});
```
